This project is a digital recreation of the classic Minesweeper game. The goal of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.   



## Gameplay

The game starts with a grid of unmarked squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), while others are safe. The player uses the left mouse button to uncover a square by double clicking. If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines. The player uses this information to deduce the location of other mines. Right-clicking a square places a flag where the player thinks a mine is located.  



## Features

* Classic Minesweeper gameplay: --- Faithful recreation of the original game's rules and mechanics.
* Interactive grid: --------------- Intuitive interface for uncovering squares and placing flags.
* Mine counter: ------------------- Displays the number of mines remaining.

@@ More features to be added including gane timer, losing animation, additional difficulties  



## Technologies Used

* VBA (Visual Basic for Applications): ---- The entire game, including the logic, algorithms, and user interface, is implemented using VBA within Microsoft Excel. VBA was chosen for its accessibility and integration with Excel, allowing for a straightforward way to create an interactive game within a familiar environment.
* Git: ---- Used for version control and collaboration (hosted on GitHub). This helps track changes, manage different versions of the code, and facilitates collaboration if needed.



## Future Development

* Improved graphics and sound: --- Enhance the visual and audio aspects of the game for a more immersive experience.
* Customizable game settings: ---- Allow players to adjust grid size, number of mines, and other parameters.
* High score tracking: ----------- Implement a system to save and display high scores.
* AI player: --------------------- Develop an AI opponent that can play Minesweeper.
